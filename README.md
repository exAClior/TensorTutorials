# Tensor Tutorials

This is a repository containing the source material for several tutorials on tensor networks
in the context of quantum many-body theory and statistical mechanics. The tutorials are
hosted as a Jupyter book at https://quantumghent.github.io/TensorTutorials/.

# Local development:

Run the `build.sh` script to build the pages locally. Optionally, you can pass the `-d` flag
to update the dependencies. WARNING: the dependencies will overwrite your installation of
LateX, and the script is only tested on Ubuntu systems. Use this feature at your own risk.

```bash
./build.sh [-d]
```
